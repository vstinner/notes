Symbols
=======

By default, gdb processes an expression as C code. ``func@plt`` is valid.
Use quotes to pass special symbols.

Wrong::

    (gdb) p PyTuple_New.constprop.0
    A syntax error in expression, near `.0'.

Good::

    (gdb) p 'PyTuple_New.constprop.0'
    $5 = {PyObject *(Py_ssize_t)} 0x47cb60 <PyTuple_New>

Function with multiple locations
================================

Example::

    (gdb) b PyTuple_New
    Breakpoint 2 at 0x47cb60: PyTuple_New. (2 locations)

    (gdb) info breakpoints
    Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
    2       breakpoint     keep y   <MULTIPLE>
    2.1                         y   0x000000000047cb60 in PyTuple_New at ./Include/internal/pycore_pystate.h:141
    2.2                         y   0x000000000047d540 in PyTuple_New at ./Include/internal/pycore_pystate.h:141

    (gdb) info symbol 0x000000000047cb60
    PyTuple_New.constprop.0 in section .text

    (gdb) info symbol 0x000000000047d540
    PyTuple_New in section .text

gdb picks the first in the symbol table::

    (gdb) info address PyTuple_New
    Symbol "PyTuple_New" is a function at address 0x47cb60.

    (gdb) p PyTuple_New
    $6 = {PyObject *(Py_ssize_t)} 0x47cb60 <PyTuple_New>


``.constprop.0`` stands for "constant propagation". GCC specialized
``PyTuple_New(size)`` for ``size==0``.

There is also ``.isra.3`` which comes from ``-fipa-sra``:

    Perform **interprocedural scalar replacement** of aggregates, removal of
    unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by reference by
    parameters passed by value.

Try also:

* ``set print demangle off``
* ``set print asm-demangle``
* ``info functions PyTuple_New``


gdb commands
============

* ``info sharedlibrary``: list loaded shared libraries (see also
  ``sharedlibrary`` command to explicitly load shared libraries)
* ``info sources``: list code source files

Debug methodolody
=================

The first step is to debug is to find a reliable or highly reliable scenario to
reproduce the bug. In the worst case, it can take several days to get such
reliable scenario :-/


Code bisection
--------------

If a bug occurred recently and it didn't exist in previous versions, it's
called a regression and it should be easier to debug. If the code is tracked
by a Version Control System (VCS like Git or Mercurial), you can "bisect"
the source code history to find the changeset introducing the bug. Git and
Mercurial have a builtin ``bisect`` command:

* hg bisect
* git bisect

The best is to have a reliable script reproducing the bug which returns
0 on success (test succeeded, no bug) or non-zero exit code (test failed,
bug). Example of shell script::

    make || exit 125
    ./python -m test -v test_sys

``make || exit 125`` fails with the exit code 125 if the compilation fails.
It's useful to skip a revision if the project cannot be compiled at this
revision. ``hg bisect`` and ``git bisect`` skip a revision if the command exit
code is 125.

The idea is similar to :ref:`dichotomy <debug-dichotomy>`: reduce the quantity
of code that have to be read to find a bug.


.. _debug-dichotomy:

Dichotomy
---------

Dichotomy or "divide to conquer" ;-)

The idea of the "dichotomy" methodology is to reduce the quantity of executed
code before the bug is triggered. To reduce the quantity of code, you can:

* comment function calls
* disable most features: turn off logging, turn off audio and/or video
  playback, etc.
* comment large partion of code

The goal is not the reduce the code to a single line of code reproducing the
bug. The goal is the reduce the quantity of code that should be read manually
to find the bug.

The debug method can sometimes take several hours, so it's nice to have
"milestones": backup points where the bug can still be reproduced. If you
use a Version Control System (VCS like Git or Mercurial), you can use local
commits (ex: create a local branch in git). Don't worry of the change content
or the commit message, ``plop`` is a great commit message for such changes :-)
These milestones are important to be able to go backward if the bug cannot be
reproduced anymore when you disabled too much code and features.

Add printf
----------

Debuggers are great, convenient and powerful. But. Sometimes, a bug cannot be
reproduce in the debugger for an unknown reason, or the control flow is too
complex to run the application in a debugger. For example, it's hard to debug
an event based application where a single logical "function" (or coroutine) is
splitted into several small callbacks.

In such case, an easy method is to add "print" calls (ex: ``printf()`` in C or
``print`` in Python) in the code to "dump" the control flow, to try to bisect
manually the code. Example of a Python function body::

    func1(a)
    func2(b)
    return func3(c)

Add ``print`` calls to see where the bug is triggered::

    print("func1")
    func1(a)
    print("func2")
    func2(b)
    print("func3")
    res = func3(c)
    print("exit")
    return res

The last instruction was splitted into two instructions to see if the bug
occurs before the call to ``func3()`` or after.

If you see ``func1`` and ``func2`` but not ``func3``, the bug occurred after
the line ``print("func2")`` and before ``print("func3")``, so the bug occurred
on the ``func2()`` call.

You can now remove the ``print("func1")`` line (to have a less verbose output),
and continue to add ``print`` calls inside the ``func2()`` function.  Iterate
until you have a few functions to read to find the bug. It's common to get the
failing line in less than 5 iterations, the technic looks very basic, but it's
fast if the scenario to reproduce the bug is reliable.

Debugging can be painful, so don't hesitate to make it more funny by using
less boring messages than ``func1`` or ``func3`` :-) I'm using:

* ``LA`` (here in french)
* ``1``
* ``1b``
* ``pouet``
* ``@@@@@@@@@@@``
* etc.

.. note::
   If the source code is not tracked by a Version Control System (VCS like Git
   or Mercurial), don't forget to create backup of files to easily remove
   these print calls when the bug is identified.

Write a core dump in disk
=========================

Fedora catchs fatal errors like segmentation faults with its application ABRT.
To develop, sometimes it helps to get a core dump. It's possible to write
a core dump on disk with::

    ulimit -c unlimited
    sudo bash -c "echo '%e-%p.core' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern"

Test::

    $ python3
    >>> import faulthandler; faulthandler._sigsegv()
    Erreur de segmentation (core dumped)
    $ ls *core*
    python3-27542.core


Display a wchar_t string
========================

Use this macro::

    define wc_print
    echo "
    set $c = (wchar_t*)$arg0
    while ( *$c )
      if ( *$c > 0x7f )
        printf "[%x]", *$c
      else
        printf "%c", *$c
      end
      set $c++
    end
    echo "\n
    end


Breakpoint in GDB
=================

Write following code into ``bp.py``::

    class MyBreakpoint(gdb.Breakpoint):
        def stop(self):
            caller = gdb.newest_frame().older()
            caller_name = caller.name() if caller else 'none'
            return (caller_name != 'func_dealloc')

    MyBreakpoint('func_clear')

In gdb, type: ``source bp.py``.

It puts a breakpoint on the function ``func_clear()`` but stop if the
the caller function name is not ``func_dealloc()``.
