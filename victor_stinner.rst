I am paid by Red Hat to maintain Python upstream and downstream (RHEL, CentOS,
Fedora & Software collections). They also cover the cost of travels to Pycon US
and EuroPython: meeting people is as important if not more than code. :ref:`My
contributions to Python <python-contrib>`.

Awards
======

* In October 2017, Gregory P. Smith of Google nominated me for a `Google Open
  Source Peer Bonus
  <https://opensource.googleblog.com/2017/10/more-open-source-peer-bonus-winners.html>`_
  for my work on CPython
* In April 2016, the OpenStack project nominated me for the `The Infinite
  Rebase Shield
  <http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-community-contributor-awards-recognize-unsung-heroes/>`_
  Award for my work on porting OpenStack to Python 3:

    In the face of endless rebases, Stinner has tirelessly pushed OpenStack
    toward Python 3. I get the impression that it has been hard at times to get
    the necessary reviews for his Python 3 porting work; especially for the
    projects he’s not well known on, and I hate to see him discouraged. We’re
    lucky to have such a prolific expert leading the Python 3 porting effort
    for OpenStack, and I’d like him to know that his work is appreciated.

* In August 2015, I got a `PSF Community Service Award
  <https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#august-2015>`_ for my
  work on CPython
